// ── STRICT SCHEMA ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The build is the single gate every YAML edit passes through, so it is where a
// TYPO or an INVENTED field must be caught — loudly — instead of being silently
// dropped by the engine at render time (a misspelled `colummns` or a made-up
// `higlight` used to just do nothing, with no signal). Each node kind has a
// WHITELIST of the fields the engine actually reads; any key outside it is a
// hard error that names the page, the node, the offending key, and (when close)
// the field it was probably meant to be.
//
// The whitelists mirror EXACTLY what engine/engine.js consumes:
//   • manifest (document.yaml): the deck identity + `palette` + the page list.
//   • page (root section): id/layout/columns/filters/sections + `form`
//     (the FORM the layout guardrail scopes its invariants by) and the
//     manifest-owned identity keys (name/order/visible) in case a page file
//     carries them.
//   • section (a node WITH `children`): buildSection + sectionHeader + the
//     per-child grid props (order/span/rowspan) + both vocabulary axes
//     (variant/treatment).
//   • component (a leaf, no `children`): buildBox / buildSeparator / buildRail /
//     buildSpacer + the per-child grid props + both vocabulary axes. A `spacer`
//     is narrowed further by SPACER_FIELDS below — it is the one leaf that reads
//     NO payload at all — and a `rail` by RAIL_FIELDS.
//   • filter (an entry of `filters[]`): the chip's key/label/steps. Filters used
//     to bypass this gate entirely — a typo in a `key` produced no error, just a
//     chip that silently dimmed the whole canvas because nothing matched it.
//   • `tokens` (manifest, section, box): the design tokens of engine/tokens.mjs.
//     The manifest may set any of them; a section or a box only the few in
//     NODE_TOKEN_KEYS. The presentation viewport is `tokens.viewport`.
//   • core chips: the manifest's `filters:` are inherited by every page, first
//     and in order (engine/chips.cjs); a page's manifest entry drops one only by
//     naming it in `omit_filters`, so the deck's chip coverage reads in one file.

// ── THE TWO ORTHOGONAL AXES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `variant` and `treatment` answer two DIFFERENT questions, and conflating them

//
//   variant   — WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? The semantic COLOUR role, in the idea's own
//               language of risk / state / kind. Exactly ONE value: a thing is
//               not simultaneously "at risk" and "hardened".
//   treatment — HOW IS THIS DRAWN? Structural / presentational modifiers that are
//               orthogonal to meaning: whether a frame is drawn at all, how the
//               content is aligned, how much of its slot the component occupies,
//               which way it runs. A LIST: they compose freely, and composing two
//               of them is normal, not exceptional.
//
// With one closed single-valued field it was impossible to say "this is at risk"
// AND "this goes without a frame" at once. Two axes make that the default case.

// `variant` is a HARD ERROR that names the axis it belongs to — a clean break, not
// a silent translation, so a deck is either on the new vocabulary or it fails
// loudly at the gate. (The legacy→new mapping is tabled in the skill's
// build.md, "The strict schema, and migrating an old deck".)

// ── CLOSED VALUE ENUMS: form / layout / type / style ───────────────────────
// The whitelists above close the KEY space; these close the VALUE space of the

// were checked, so a typo in one of these VALUES passed the gate and then failed
// SILENTLY downstream — and each of the three below is a real observed false
// green, not a hypothetical:
//   • `form: dashboards` — the guardrail scopes its invariant table by form
//     MEMBERSHIP, so an undeclared form matched no row at all and the page was
//     reported with ZERO checks ("ALL PASS — 0 checks", exit 0). Closed here at
//     the door AND at the model (its FORM check reads the same FORMS list).
//   • `layout: gird` — engine.js's `renderable` filter DROPS the page with a
//     console.warn nobody reads, so the page silently vanishes from the deck.
//     Closing it is also what makes the guardrail's page CENSUS sound: rendered
//     `.act` count can only equal `__DOC__.pages.length` if no page can be
//     dropped at render time.
//   • `type: seperator` — the leaf dispatch in buildGrid falls through to
//     buildBox, so the typo renders an EMPTY card that every invariant happily
//     counts as a filled cell.
//   • `style: dotetd` — buildSeparator's `sep.style === 'dotted'` ternary
//     silently yields 'solid'. The mildest of the four; closed for symmetry, so
//     no dispatched value is left unchecked.
// Same shape as PALETTES above: a closed Set, a `.has()` gate, and a `suggest()`
// near-miss hint naming the valid values.

// legitimate a hole as a single cell, and `span`/`rowspan` belong to the CELL
// rather than to its content.
//
// Everything else is rejected BY NAME rather than ignored. Every remaining

// detail/note) are what buildBox renders and buildSpacer never reads, `variant`/
// `variant_extra` colour a frame that is not drawn, every `treatment` aligns or
// divides content that does not exist (and `half` would pair it into a slot it
// cannot share), `style` is the separator's line, and `filters` would make the

//   vertical + description → same reason: the text block is rotated, so a
//                         description has no horizontal room to wrap into.
//   half + rowspan      → a contradiction of axes: `rowspan` grows a cell by WHOLE

//   stack — compound grids stop laying sections side by side: they fold into a
//           column and every child keeps its content height (a flex-basis would
//           size the HEIGHT in column direction), stretched to the full width.
//           align-content:stretch is needed beside align-items: in a
//           column-direction wrap flex the single line otherwise shrink-wraps.
//   two   — every multi-column leaf grid steps to the 2-track intermediate; a
//           partial span keeps its proportion (--span2) and the separator rows
//           are re-derived for that track count (--row-tracks-2).
//   one   — the endpoint: every leaf grid is one track, a partial span becomes a
//           full band, every separator row is thin (--row-tracks-1), and the
//           canvas chrome shrinks to the narrow frame. The :not(.sec-c1) twins
