# assets/ — the portable diagram engine

A drop-in, zero-runtime-dependency diagram deck. Copy this directory into a
target repo (whole, or into a subfolder like `diagram/`) and you have a working,
themeable, data-driven diagram that opens under `file://`. Everything domain-
specific lives in `data/`; the engine layer knows only the dialect.

## The layout model — a filled, capped grid of uniform-height cells

Two primitives, nothing else. A **section** is a node with a `children` array;
it renders as a CSS-Grid `columns` wide, and its children auto-flow left→right
and wrap down. A **component** is a leaf; it renders by its `type` — `box`
(default) · `separator` · `rail`. Merges run on **two axes**: any child may set
`span: M` to merge across M of the parent's columns (`1 < M < columns` is a
real PARTIAL merge; `span == columns` is a full-width **band** on its own row),
and a leaf cell may set `rowspan: K` to merge down K rows (height as
magnitude). The page/root is itself a section. Nesting is a section whose
children are sections — a grid of grids. There is no envelope primitive, no
subsection, no mosaic, no `wraps` — the engine is one recursive
`buildSection` / `buildGrid` pair, with no JS layout or measurement pass.

A leaf grid divides its section's width into `columns` EQUAL `fr` tracks:
cells STRETCH to fill (equal width within a grid, fixed `--cell-h = 130px`
height, one `gap: 8px` gutter everywhere), every row spans the section
edge-to-edge, and each track keeps a **readable 120px floor**
(`--cell-min-w`) — columns collapse before a cell degrades to illegible text.
The plane **fills the canvas up to a centered 1280px cap** (`.sec-plane`), and
the column count **cascades …→2→1** as width tightens (2-column intermediate,
1-column single-stack endpoint), so nothing scrolls sideways at the stacked
tiers. Positioning is a known operation: change `columns`/`span`/`rowspan`/
`order` and the guardrail proves the grid adds up.

## Use

- **View immediately:** open `index.html` in any browser. The committed
  `data/data.generated.js` means it renders with no tooling.
- **Author:** edit the YAML under `data/`, then `npm run build` to regenerate
  `data/data.generated.js` (the build also enforces the strict field schema).
  Nothing to install: the deck has no npm dependencies. Then **`npm run model`
  — the mandatory gate**: arithmetic over the authored YAML, no browser. Never
  declare a layout change done until it is green. Whether the page LOOKS right
  is a human review: open `index.html` and look. `npm run census -- --json`
  prints what each page resolved to, so it can be checked against the sketch
  agreed before building without reading the YAML. Its fields, at the
  presentation viewport:
  - `width` has ONE normal form: the reduced fraction of the parent's width
    (`1/1` is the whole row, `1/2` half, `2/3` two thirds), or `content` for a
    component sitting directly in a flex row. The share comes from
    `check-layout.mjs` `rowShare`, the rule the model's width chain uses.
  - `start` is `{row, col}`, 1-based within the parent: the grid cell, or the
    line and position on it in a flex row. A section's `grid` says which:
    `tracks` and a root holding a band are grids, `row` is a flex row, `stack`
    (`columns: 1`) puts one child per row — so two groups side by side share a
    row, and two stacked groups do not.
  - `variant_source` is `authored`, `default` (an unset colour is neutral; the
    engine never inherits one from a section) or `colourless` (separator, spacer).
  - a chip's `scope` is `members`, `all` (the reserved reset, which declares no
    members and lights everything) or `none`.

  `npm test` runs the
  negative-test suite over the guards themselves, and `npm run contrast` audits
  the palettes against WCAG 2.1.
- **The dialect** (every field and the `variant`/`treatment` sets) is documented
  in the diagram-builder skill's `../build.md`.
- **`document.yaml`'s optional `version`** renders in the header — bump it on a
  meaningful change. The engine also
  supports click-and-drag panning on the canvas (grab/grabbing cursor) as a
  free interaction alongside wheel/trackpad scroll, and a help HUD (H key or the
  "?" button) that explains the whole visual vocabulary.

## Responsive behavior

The layout is pure CSS, driven by the STAGE container query (works under
split-screen / narrow panes, not just the viewport):

- **Wide (>1440px)** — sections sit side by side at their authored `columns`;
  the plane fills to the 1280px cap and centers (no horizontal scroll).
- **Stacked (≤1440px)** — compound rows fold into a full-width vertical stack.
- **Two-table (≤1000px)** — a 3-/4-/5-column leaf grid steps to 2 equal tracks.
- **Endpoint (≤640px)** — every leaf grid drops to 1 track; the whole page is a
  single vertical stack in authored order.

A band (`span == columns`) stays full-width at every tier; a PARTIAL span keeps
its proportion at the 2-track tier (`--span2 = round(M/N·2)`) and becomes a
full band only at the 1-column endpoint; a `rowspan` cell keeps its K-row
height through the horizontal cascade. There is no JS layout pass and no
per-section breakpoint.

## Deploy: cache-busting & no-cache

`index.html`, `engine/engine.js`, and `data/data.generated.js` are a **coupled
contract**: they change together on every meaningful deck change (a new page,
a reworked layout, a rebuilt `data.generated.js`). A browser that caches any
one of the three independently can pair a stale `engine.js`/`data.generated.js`
with a fresh `index.html` after a release — the classic stale-assets bug.
This seed ships **with no server** (it is copied whole into a target repo and
opens under `file://` with zero tooling), so it cannot bundle a fix that lives
in a server layer the target may not have. Two things are already in place for
whatever the target repo's deploy layer turns out to be:

- **A cache-busting placeholder is already on the two coupled `<script>` tags**
  in `index.html`: `data/data.generated.js?v={{DIAGRAM_DECK_VERSION}}` and
  `engine/engine.js?v={{DIAGRAM_DECK_VERSION}}`. Left unsubstituted, the query
  string is harmless — a static file server or `file://` resolves the path and
  ignores it, so "view immediately" still works with no visible change.
- **Wire up the placeholder when you deploy behind anything that serves these
  files** (a server that templates the HTML, a CI build step, a static-site
  generator): substitute `{{DIAGRAM_DECK_VERSION}}` with the real deck version
  (`data/document.yaml`'s `version`, or the repo's release tag) so every
  release produces distinct asset URLs and the browser is forced to fetch the
  new pair instead of reusing the old one.
- **Add a no-cache safety net as a second layer**, in whatever serves the
  three coupled paths (`/`, `/index.html`, `/engine/engine.js`,
  `/data/data.generated.js`): send `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`
  on those responses (relying on ETag for revalidation, which most static
  file servers already set). This covers the case the placeholder is left
  unsubstituted or a proxy ignores the query string — the browser may keep a
  cached copy but must always revalidate with the server before using it, so
  it can never serve a stale copy silently. A worked example (a FastAPI app
  serving this exact seed) sets this via one `@app.middleware("http")` that
  checks `request.url.path` against the four coupled paths and sets the
  header on the response — the same pattern applies to any framework or
  static-file layer (nginx `add_header`, an S3/CloudFront cache policy, etc).
- **If the target has no server at all** (pure static hosting, `file://`,
  opened straight from the repo), there is nothing to wire up — the
  placeholder degrades to a no-op query string and the deck still renders
  correctly; you are simply not protected from the stale-pair bug until a
  serving layer exists.

## Genericized from the reference artifact

Vendored from a frozen reference architecture-diagram artifact (HUD included)
and made domain-free: neutral title/subtitle placeholders (the engine overwrites
them from `document.yaml`), domain names stripped from comments, a generic
`package.json` name, and a domain-free seed `data/`. No absolute paths and no
`node_modules`: the YAML is read by the deck's own `engine/yaml.cjs`.
