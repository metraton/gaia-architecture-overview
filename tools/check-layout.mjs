// check-layout.mjs — the MANDATORY, PROGRAMMATIC layout gate. No browser.
// @version 1.0.0  (part of the diagram-builder skill; keep the placement model in
//                  sync with engine/engine.js buildGrid + the container-query
//                  tiers in index.html)
//
// Run: npm run model   (or: node tools/check-layout.mjs [deckRoot])
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE GATE
// The layout of this deck is a SPREADSHEET: a filled rectangle of uniform cells.
// "Filled rectangle" is not an aesthetic judgement — it is an ARITHMETIC IDENTITY,
// and an identity can be tested like a unit test:
//
//        Σ (spanCols × rowspanRows)  ===  tracks × rowCount
//
// The left side is what the DATA authors; the right side is the rectangle the grid
// draws. They are equal exactly when the rectangle CLOSES. Any hole — a track no
// cell reaches, a short last row, a merge that did not fit and pushed itself down —
// leaves the sum SHORT BY EXACTLY ITS OWN AREA. So the defect is not merely
// detected, it is MEASURED, and it is measured without pixels, without a render,
// and without Playwright.
//
// That matters beyond speed. Gaia is installed in places where no browser exists.
// A guardrail that needs Chromium is a guardrail that is ABSENT precisely where a
// deck is most likely to be authored blind. So `npm run model` — this file,
// static, arithmetic, no dependency — is the mandatory gate: it proves the layout
// CLOSES and the data is sound, and it has never seen a pixel. Whether the page
// LOOKS right is a human review of the rendered deck.
//
// WHY ARITHMETIC IS ENOUGH: the collapse is a CONTAINER QUERY. The cuts at
// 640 / 1000 / 1440 px depend on NOTHING except the stage container's width, so
// "a 4-column grid renders 2 tracks at 900px" is a PURE FUNCTION of
// (authoredColumns, containerWidth) — `tracksFor` below — checked here at five
// container widths in milliseconds.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
//   RECT   the closure identity above, per grid, per tier. Reports any deficit as
//          an exact cell area.
//   HOLE   interior holes enumerated by coordinate — a merge that did not fit in
//          the tracks left on its row and dropped down, leaving a gap ABOVE it.
//   TRACK  a dead track: a column the content never reaches.
//   ROW    an orphan row: a lone single cell on its own row while a sibling row
//          holds two or more.
//   LANE   rail-led swimlanes of unequal length within one grid (hard), and
//          parallel single-column stacks of unequal depth (advisory).
//   FROZEN an undeclared hole UNDER an element that cannot grow: a `vertical`
//          box (its height IS its authored rowspan) inside a stretched flex row
//          that a taller sibling sets. Heights are floors, so it under-states.
//   BAND   band placement: a band owns its whole row, and a declared span never
//          exceeds the columns it is placed in.
//   TIER   the derived tracks-per-tier table, and the monotonicity of the cascade
//          (tracks never grow as the container narrows).
//   CHIP   filter referential integrity in BOTH directions, plus ARITY: a chip
//          with a single member does not express a relation, and since an active
//          chip dims everything it does not name, a one-member chip switches the
//          deck off.
//   CHIP-X a chip key carries one label on every page: a core chip (declared in
//          document.yaml) is inherited first, and a page chip reusing a key agrees.
//   HARMONY opt-in: every box and rail belongs to at least one chip, the lead
//          band exempt. The lead's own shape is refused at build (checkLead).
//   LIT   a filter declared on a leaf type the engine never lights (separator,
//          spacer): the CHIP join closes and the render cannot show it.
//   RAILT  a thin rail's title past its two-line ceiling: the rail row is `auto`
//          and `.rail-title` has no clamp, so a third line GROWS the row.
//   ORDER  a duplicate effective `order` among siblings — today resolved silently
//          by the index tie-break, so the author's intended sequence is a
//          coin flip that can change under an unrelated edit.
//   TEXT   the character budget (ADVISORY): title token, kicker token, title
//          clamp, description clamp.
//   WORDS  every authored string is present verbatim in the generated bundle —
//          the text-only staleness CENSUS cannot see.
//   INK    the height budget of a box against its row (a `compact` grid's own
//          shorter row included), on every page not declared `text_fit: advisory`.
//   HEADER a section title/subtitle against its clamp at the zone's inner width.
//   HEIGHT the page height predicted from the placement model against the
//          `document.yaml` viewport (ADVISORY).
//   SPAN   the stylesheet implements the span→tracks rules every width here
//          assumes.
//   CENSUS data/*.yaml vs data/data.generated.js (via tools/static-census.cjs,
//          the one parse path every tool shares).
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, ON PURPOSE
// Arithmetic knows the rectangle closes; it does not know the text fits inside it.
// Pixel legibility, mid-word wrapping, the flex wrap point and real rendered
// proportions are for the person looking at the deck. This file never claims them,
// and never pretends a green run here is a verdict on how the deck LOOKS.
//
// NO FALSE GREEN. Two structural rules:
//   • a run that asserted NOTHING is RED, never green (the `total === 0` gate).
//   • the deck root is taken from argv/env so this gate can be pointed at a BROKEN
//     FIXTURE outside the repo and be SHOWN to fail. A guardrail only ever run
//     against the deck that is supposed to pass has never been shown to work.

// double click, so it has no module system to share one through.

// engine's own functions from its real source and asserts they agree with these
// over a corpus of grid shapes, including a span-3-of-4 at the 2-track tier.

// How many TRACKS one slot occupies at a tier. Mirrors the CSS rules that govern
// a merge as the grid collapses:
//   .msp   (span >= cols)      grid-column: 1 / -1  — full width at EVERY tier
//   .mspan (1 < span < cols)   grid-column: span var(--span)  at the authored tier,

// ── THE TEXT BUDGET: CHARACTERS, NOT PIXELS ───────────────────────────────
// Everything above is geometry, and geometry is where arithmetic is EXACT. TEXT
// is the one irreducible thing left — the defect the eye kept catching with all
// three gates green: a description cut mid-sentence, a title wrapped past its
// clamp, a rotated label clipped with no ellipsis. So this is the one
// APPROXIMATE check in the file, and it is declared as such:
//
//        IT MARKS WHAT IS RISKY. IT NEVER BLESSES WHAT IS GOOD.
//
// The direction is chosen, not incidental. The DEMAND is over-estimated (the
// monospace advance below is the CEILING of the families the CSS names) and the
// CELL is derived from the stylesheet's own chrome, so a text flagged here is
// genuinely near its limit. The converse does not hold — a text that passes here
// can still wrap badly in a real font — which is exactly why every finding is an
// ADVISORY ([INFO], never a failure) and the person looking at the deck rules.
// This file never claims an authority the arithmetic does not have.
//
// THE KICKER TOKEN IS THE ONE ROLE WITH NO RULING ABOVE IT, AND IT IS STILL AN
// ADVISORY. `kicker-token` (see textBudget) budgets `.box .k` exactly as `token`
// budgets `.box .t`, and it was added because the eye caught a fracture the
// budget could not see: it measured titles only. There is no render invariant
// for the kicker — N covers the title alone — so unlike every other kind here,
// this one has no verdict downstream of it. That is an argument for making it
// [FAIL], and it is outweighed by the argument against: the measurement is the
// SAME approximation as the others (one assumed constant, MONO_ADVANCE_EM, and
// a chain of mirrored stylesheet numbers), and a check calibrated to
// over-estimate demand must not be the thing that stops a build. Two severities
// over one arithmetic would say the estimate is trustworthy for the kicker and
// merely indicative for the title, which is false. So it reports as [INFO] with
// the others, and the gap it leaves — no pixel ruling for the kicker — is a
// stated limitation rather than one papered over with a harder verdict.
//
// WHY CHARACTERS AND NOT PIXELS. Both text roles are MONOSPACE (`--mono`), so a
// token's width is its LENGTH times one advance — which means the cell can be
// expressed as "how many characters fit". That is the author's own unit, and it
// is what lets every finding name the number MEASURED, the number AVAILABLE and
// the exact CELL instead of offering generic advice.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. A `vertical` treatment rotates the title onto the block
// axis, where the constraint is the cell's HEIGHT, not its width — exempt here
// for the same reason N exempts it. A box sitting DIRECTLY in a nested compound
// grid is content-sized (`.sec-grid.sec-compound > .box { flex:0 0 auto }`), so
// it has no track to be budgeted against and is not visited: only grids with a
// real track model are.

// it actually gets, and how a box left far shorter than its row leaves an

// is DERIVED from the authored spans through this file's width chain, so INK is a
// claim about the cell the stylesheet OWES the box, never about the cell the
// browser drew. When the two disagree INK reports the model and stays green:
// measured, it passed a title at 47.4px of a 63.0px slot while Chromium clamped
// that very title, because the real cell was 179.5px wide instead of the modelled
// 236.6px. The arithmetic was right and the render was wrong; the divergence
// that produced it is now caught by the CSS span->tracks shapes above.
//
// OPT-OUT, not opt-in: every page is asserted unless it declares
// `text_fit: advisory`, which demotes its overflows to [INFO]. An overflow FAILS
// only at the presentation tier (`document.yaml` `viewport.w`) — the width the
// deck is shown at — and advises at the others. The three-line description clamp
// puts a full box at ~128 of 130px, so a box that fails here is one whose text

// `.box .k` and `.box .t` declare no line-height, so they render at the family's

// Width is a negotiation between tracks; HEIGHT is not. A leaf grid's rows are
// FIXED tracks (`grid-auto-rows: var(--row-tracks, var(--cell-h))`), so a grid's
// height is a sum over rows the placement already knows: --cell-h each, or
// --sep-row-h for a THIN row. Every number is a mirrored declaration the CSS
// check asserts against index.html — none of it is estimated.
//
// THE ONE THING THIS CHAIN REFUSES TO GUESS is a zone HEADER's height: a clamped
// mono title plus an optional three-line subtitle needs a line-height the
// stylesheet never declares, and guessing it would drag the TEXT budget's
// approximation into a geometric verdict. So the header is EXCLUDED and only the
// gap it costs is counted. That makes every height below a FLOOR — the zone is
// at LEAST this tall, never at most — and that direction is the whole
// calibration of FROZEN.

// Mirrors engine.js `isThinRowLeaf`: a row whose occupants are ALL thin leaves
// — horizontal separators, DECLARED HOLES, or horizontal no-rowspan RAILS —
// renders reduced: --sep-row-h for separators and holes, content height
// (`auto`) for a row that holds a rail. Mirrored rather than imported for the
// same reason the placement model is (an ES module is CORS-blocked from a
// `file://` script), and ASSERTED against the engine's copy by the AGREE/thin
// case in tools/test-guards.mjs. A wrong `false` here is the safe direction:
// it only ever makes a reported hole smaller.
// A thin separator row on the LAST row is emitted as minmax(--sep-row-h, 1fr)
// so a declared hole absorbs the slack a stretched section leaves, which keeps
// --sep-row-h a FLOOR there rather than the height — consistent with every
// height in this chain already being a floor. A rail's exclusions mirror the
// engine's: a VERTICAL rail's ink IS the row height, and a rail with `rowspan`
// labels a lane down several rows.

  // pushed its neighbour 90px past a bar that could not follow.
  //
  // WHY IT FAILS WHERE TEXT ONLY INFORMS. TEXT rests on an ASSUMED constant and
  // OVER-states demand, so it can flag text that is fine — an estimate must not
  // stop a build. This rests on no assumed constant: every input is a mirrored
  // declaration (asserted against index.html by the CSS check) or an exact
  // structural count, and the one unknowable — the zone header's height — is
  // EXCLUDED rather than estimated. So the arithmetic UNDER-states the hole and
  // the error runs the other way: a finding is a real hole of AT LEAST the size
  // reported. That is a verdict, like RECT's, not a warning.
  //
  // SCOPE, and therefore what it does not see:
  //   • GRID_DENSE forms only, exactly as ROW is: "a hole under a frozen element
  //     is a defect" is the compaction claim, and a timeline or a mind-map may
  //     leave vertical air on purpose.
  //   • only above the stack breakpoint — below it a compound is a COLUMN, so
  //     there is no shared row height and no hole to open.
  //   • only a frozen leaf inside a HEADERLESS LEAF-GRID section (the `plain`
  //     wrapper idiom that gives a rotated box its vertical axis). With a header
  //     the frozen side's own height stops being exact, and comparing two floors
  //     could invent a hole that is not there.
  //   • a frozen box sitting DIRECTLY in a compound is exempt for a different
  //     reason: the stylesheet pins it (`flex:0 0 auto; align-self:start;
  //     height:var(--cell-h)`), so its short height is DECLARED in the CSS
  //     rather than left to a neighbour's arithmetic.
  //   • a hole SMALLER than the header it declined to measure is invisible here.
  //     That is the price of never crying wolf, and it is paid on purpose.
