// check-layout.mjs — the MANDATORY, PROGRAMMATIC layout gate. No browser.
// @version 1.0.0  (part of the diagram-builder skill; keep the placement model in
//                  sync with engine/engine.js buildGrid + the container-query
//                  tiers in index.html)
//
// Run: npm run check   (or: node tools/check-layout.mjs [deckRoot])
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE GATE
// The layout of this deck is a SPREADSHEET: a filled rectangle of uniform cells.
// "Filled rectangle" is not an aesthetic judgement — it is an ARITHMETIC IDENTITY,
// and an identity can be tested like a unit test:
//
//        Σ (spanCols × rowspanRows)  ===  tracks × rowCount
//
// The left side is what the DATA authors; the right side is the rectangle the grid
// draws. They are equal exactly when the rectangle CLOSES. Any hole — a track no
// cell reaches, a short last row, a merge that did not fit and pushed itself down —
// leaves the sum SHORT BY EXACTLY ITS OWN AREA. So the defect is not merely
// detected, it is MEASURED, and it is measured without pixels, without a render,
// and without Playwright.
//
// That matters beyond speed. Gaia is installed in places where no browser exists.
// A guardrail that needs Chromium is a guardrail that is ABSENT precisely where a
// deck is most likely to be authored blind. So the division of labour is:
//
//   npm run check     MANDATORY. Static, arithmetic, js-yaml only (already a build
//                     dependency). Proves the layout CLOSES and the data is sound.
//   npm run validate  OPTIONAL REINFORCEMENT. Renders one width in Chromium and
//                     asserts only what genuinely needs PIXELS (legibility, word
//                     fit, text truncation, flex wrap points, real geometry).
//                     Skips cleanly and exits 0 where no browser exists.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES: the browser width SWEEP. `validate` used to render 5 widths ×
// 2 themes × 5 reloads to prove the …→2→1 collapse cascade. But the collapse is a
// CONTAINER QUERY: the cuts at 640 / 1000 / 1440 px depend on NOTHING except the
// stage container's width, so "a 4-column grid renders 2 tracks at 900px" is a PURE
// FUNCTION of (authoredColumns, containerWidth) — `tracksFor` below. Once that is
// arithmetic, re-measuring it in a browser five times is re-confirming a
// multiplication table. The sweep is gone; the identity is checked at all five of
// its former widths here, in milliseconds.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
//   RECT   the closure identity above, per grid, per tier. Reports any deficit as
//          an exact cell area. Supersedes the render-time L (cells fill width).
//   HOLE   interior holes enumerated by coordinate — a merge that did not fit in
//          the tracks left on its row and dropped down, leaving a gap ABOVE it.
//   TRACK  a dead track: a column the content never reaches. Supersedes E.
//   ROW    an orphan row: a lone single cell on its own row while a sibling row
//          holds two or more. Supersedes P.
//   LANE   rail-led swimlanes of unequal length within one grid (hard), and
//          parallel single-column stacks of unequal depth (advisory).
//   FROZEN an undeclared hole UNDER an element that cannot grow: a `vertical`
//          box (its height IS its authored rowspan) inside a stretched flex row
//          that a taller sibling sets. Heights are floors, so it under-states.
//   BAND   band placement: a band owns its whole row, and a declared span never
//          exceeds the columns it is placed in.
//   TIER   the derived tracks-per-tier table, and the monotonicity of the cascade
//          (tracks never grow as the container narrows). Supersedes F.
//   CHIP   filter referential integrity in BOTH directions, plus ARITY: a chip
//          with a single member does not express a relation, and since an active
//          chip dims everything it does not name, a one-member chip switches the
//          deck off. Supersedes K, which only closed the join.
//   ORDER  a duplicate effective `order` among siblings — today resolved silently
//          by the index tie-break, so the author's intended sequence is a
//          coin flip that can change under an unrelated edit.
//   CENSUS data/*.yaml vs data/data.generated.js (shared with validate, via
//          tools/static-census.cjs — one parse path, so the two gates cannot
//          disagree about what the data says).
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, ON PURPOSE
// Arithmetic knows the rectangle closes; it does not know the text fits inside it.
// Pixel legibility, mid-word wrapping, description clamping, the flex wrap point,
// real rendered proportions, and sibling collision are RENDER truths and stay in
// `validate`. This file never claims them, and never pretends a green run here is
// a verdict on how the deck LOOKS.
//
// NO FALSE GREEN. Two structural rules, mirroring validate's own:
//   • a run that asserted NOTHING is RED, never green (the `total === 0` gate).
//   • the deck root is taken from argv/env so this gate can be pointed at a BROKEN
//     FIXTURE outside the repo and be SHOWN to fail. A guardrail only ever run
//     against the deck that is supposed to pass has never been shown to work.

// engine is a plain browser script under `file://`, where an ES module is
// CORS-blocked (origin 'null') — the deck's contract is that it opens with a
// double click, so it has no module system to share one through.
// The mirror is not trusted on a comment: tools/test-guards.mjs extracts the
// engine's own functions from its real source and asserts they agree with these
// over a corpus of grid shapes, including a span-3-of-4 at the 2-track tier.

// How many TRACKS one slot occupies at a tier. Mirrors the CSS rules that govern
// a merge as the grid collapses:
//   .msp   (span >= cols)      grid-column: 1 / -1  — full width at EVERY tier
//   .mspan (1 < span < cols)   grid-column: span var(--span)  at the authored tier,

//                              engine so a partial merge keeps its PROPORTION),

// ── THE TEXT BUDGET: CHARACTERS, NOT PIXELS ───────────────────────────────
// Everything above is geometry, and geometry is where arithmetic is EXACT. TEXT
// is the one irreducible thing left — the defect the eye kept catching with all
// three gates green: a description cut mid-sentence, a title wrapped past its
// clamp, a rotated label clipped with no ellipsis. So this is the one
// APPROXIMATE check in the file, and it is declared as such:
//
//        IT MARKS WHAT IS RISKY. IT NEVER BLESSES WHAT IS GOOD.
//
// The direction is chosen, not incidental. The DEMAND is over-estimated (the
// monospace advance below is the CEILING of the families the CSS names) and the
// CELL is derived from the stylesheet's own chrome, so a text flagged here is
// genuinely near its limit, and a text that fails the render gate's N is
// necessarily flagged here first. The converse does not hold — which is exactly
// why every finding is an ADVISORY ([INFO], never a failure). `validate`'s N
// measures the real font with real font metrics and is the VERDICT. The two
// COMPOSE: this is the fast warning where no browser exists, N is the ruling.
// This file never claims an authority the arithmetic does not have.
//
// THE KICKER TOKEN IS THE ONE ROLE WITH NO RULING ABOVE IT, AND IT IS STILL AN
// ADVISORY. `kicker-token` (see textBudget) budgets `.box .k` exactly as `token`
// budgets `.box .t`, and it was added because the eye caught a fracture the
// budget could not see: it measured titles only. There is no render invariant
// for the kicker — N covers the title alone — so unlike every other kind here,
// this one has no verdict downstream of it. That is an argument for making it
// [FAIL], and it is outweighed by the argument against: the measurement is the
// SAME approximation as the others (one assumed constant, MONO_ADVANCE_EM, and
// a chain of mirrored stylesheet numbers), and a check calibrated to
// over-estimate demand must not be the thing that stops a build. Two severities
// over one arithmetic would say the estimate is trustworthy for the kicker and
// merely indicative for the title, which is false. So it reports as [INFO] with
// the others, and the gap it leaves — no pixel ruling for the kicker — is a
// stated limitation rather than one papered over with a harder verdict.
//
// WHY CHARACTERS AND NOT PIXELS. Both text roles are MONOSPACE (`--mono`), so a
// token's width is its LENGTH times one advance — which means the cell can be
// expressed as "how many characters fit". That is the author's own unit, and it
// is what lets every finding name the number MEASURED, the number AVAILABLE and
// the exact CELL instead of offering generic advice.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. A `vertical` treatment rotates the title onto the block
// axis, where the constraint is the cell's HEIGHT, not its width — exempt here
// for the same reason N exempts it. A box sitting DIRECTLY in a nested compound
// grid is content-sized (`.sec-grid.sec-compound > .box { flex:0 0 auto }`), so
// it has no track to be budgeted against and is not visited: only grids with a
// real track model are.

// Mirrored from index.html and ASSERTED against it by the CSS check in main(),
// exactly as BREAKPOINTS is — computing with a mirror the stylesheet has moved
// past would be green and wrong.

// defaults DejaVu/Liberation Mono) has a fixed advance between 0.55em (Consolas)
// and 0.6023em (Menlo). 0.6 is the CEILING of that range, so a character is
// never assumed NARROWER than it renders and the estimated demand stays an upper
// bound — which is what keeps this check on the "marks the risky" side. That

  // FROZEN — an undeclared hole under something that CANNOT GROW.
  //
  // Above the stack breakpoint a compound grid is a flex ROW with
  // align-items:stretch, so every section in it is as tall as the TALLEST one.
  // The section stretches; the fixed rows inside it do not. For ordinary content
  // that is the doctrine's "the hole speaks" — the author can close it with a
  // row or declare it, and the deck does exactly that in places. For a
  // `vertical` box it is neither: a rotated bar's LENGTH is its assertion (its
  // height is authored as `rowspan`), so it cannot be grown to meet the row
  // without saying something else — and nothing in the data ties that rowspan to
  // the neighbour that sets the row height. The author did that arithmetic once,
  // in their head; any later change to the neighbour reopens the hole in
  // silence. This check IS the missing tie, and it is the defect the eye caught
  // when a thin separator row grew back to --cell-h and pushed its neighbour
  // 90px past a bar that could not follow.
  //
  // WHY IT FAILS WHERE TEXT ONLY INFORMS. TEXT rests on an ASSUMED constant and
  // OVER-states demand, so it can flag text that is fine — an estimate must not
  // stop a build. This rests on no assumed constant: every input is a mirrored
  // declaration (asserted against index.html by the CSS check) or an exact
  // structural count, and the one unknowable — the zone header's height — is
  // EXCLUDED rather than estimated. So the arithmetic UNDER-states the hole and
  // the error runs the other way: a finding is a real hole of AT LEAST the size
  // reported. That is a verdict, like RECT's, not a warning.
  //
  // SCOPE, and therefore what it does not see:
  //   • GRID_DENSE forms only, exactly as ROW is: "a hole under a frozen element
  //     is a defect" is the compaction claim, and a timeline or a mind-map may
  //     leave vertical air on purpose.
  //   • only above the stack breakpoint — below it a compound is a COLUMN, so
  //     there is no shared row height and no hole to open.
  //   • only a frozen leaf inside a HEADERLESS LEAF-GRID section (the `plain`
  //     wrapper idiom that gives a rotated box its vertical axis). With a header
  //     the frozen side's own height stops being exact, and comparing two floors
  //     could invent a hole that is not there.
  //   • a frozen box sitting DIRECTLY in a compound is exempt for a different
  //     reason: the stylesheet pins it (`flex:0 0 auto; align-self:start;
  //     height:var(--cell-h)`), so its short height is DECLARED in the CSS
  //     rather than left to a neighbour's arithmetic.
  //   • a hole SMALLER than the header it declined to measure is invisible here.
  //     That is the price of never crying wolf, and it is paid on purpose.
