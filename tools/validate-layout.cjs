// validate-layout.cjs — the LAYOUT GUARDRAIL for a uniform-cell diagram deck.
// @version 2.0.0  (part of the diagram-builder skill; keep the engine generation
//                  in sync with engine/engine.js + engine/build-data.mjs)
//
// This is the hard gate that proves the spreadsheet-style grid still "adds up"
// after any change to data/ or the engine/CSS. It is GENERIC (domain-agnostic):
// it discovers the pages from the rendered deck and asserts each invariant
// against the REAL rendered geometry (getBoundingClientRect), not against the
// data — a CSS or data edit cannot silently break the layout without failing
// here.
//
// FLOW:  edit data/pages/*.yaml  →  npm run build  →  npm run validate  →  npm run verify
//   Each step is explicit and single-purpose. `validate` is DECOUPLED from
//   `build`: it does NOT regenerate data — it renders and asserts the EXISTING
//   data/data.generated.js. So you must `npm run build` first (build generates,
//   validate only validates). This keeps `validate` PURE-READ (no file writes to
//   the project, no child build process) — a genuinely read-only guardrail.
//
// NO FALSE GREEN. Three structural rules make a green verdict mean something:
//   • A run that measured NOTHING is RED, never green. An undeclared page `form`
//     used to match no invariant row at all, so the page reported `ALL PASS —
//     0 checks` with exit 0 (invariant A + the total===0 gate in reportVerdict).
//   • A page is joined to its manifest entry BY ID (`data-page-id`), never by
//     index. Position is not identity: a positional join reports a page under a
//     neighbour's name AND form, and silently empties the authored-span lookup.
//   • AUTHORED == RENDERED is itself asserted (invariant Z + the STATIC census
//     pre-flight). Geometry checks cannot see content that is MISSING, and a
//     `validate` decoupled from `build` cannot see that it is reading stale data.
//
// WHAT IT DOES
//   0. PRE-FLIGHT, before any browser: re-parses data/*.yaml with js-yaml and
//      censuses it against data/data.generated.js. A mismatch means the generated
//      data is STALE — it says "run build" and exits 1 (see staticCensus).
//   1. Reads the EXISTING data/data.generated.js (built by the prior `npm run
//      build` step) — validate does not regenerate it, so run build first.
//   2. Launches headless Chromium and renders EVERY page at ONE viewport width
//      (2560, the widest tier — see WIDTHS) — the 3→2→1 collapse cascade itself
//      is now proven arithmetically by tools/check-layout.mjs (TIER), not re-
//      rendered here at multiple widths.
//   3. For every page it renders 3 TIMES with a real reload (F5) and ASSERTS
//      the geometry is identical across passes (determinism).
//   4. Measures the real geometry of every leaf box, section zone, and header,
//      and ASSERTS each layout invariant.
//   5. Writes a FULL-PAGE screenshot per (page,width) to a SYSTEM TEMP DIR
//      (os.tmpdir(); override with DIAGRAM_SHOTS_DIR) — never into the project.
//   6. Prints a per-(page,width) PASS/FAIL table and exits non-zero on any fail.
//
// INVARIANTS ASSERTED (each measured from the live render):
//   A  form is declared     — the page's `form` is one of FORMS. Synthetic and
//                            fail-closed: an undeclared form matches NO row in the
//                            form-scoped table, so the render measured NOTHING and
//                            printed `ALL PASS — 0 checks`, exit 0. A is returned
//                            INSTEAD of that empty set (see runInvariants); the
//                            `total === 0` gate in reportVerdict is the second,
//                            independent layer of the same defence.
//   Z  CENSUS (authored ==  — the deck RENDERED everything the data AUTHORS:
//      rendered)             `.act` count vs `__DOC__.pages.length`, and per page
//                            sections / boxes / separators / rails / spacers /
//                            half-slots / leaf-grids vs the authored walk (which mirrors
//                            engine.js buildGrid). Every other invariant measures
//                            geometry that IS on screen, so none of them can see
//                            content that is MISSING — drop a page or a section and
//                            the remaining geometry is still perfectly valid. Sound
//                            only because the page join is by id, not by index.
//   D  DETERMINISM         — N reloads produce byte-identical geometry (cell
//                            sizes, per-grid column counts, section widths, wrap
//                            structure). Catches an F5 column/wrap flip.
//   R  scrollbar-robust    — at wide tiers, shaving a scrollbar's width off the
//                            available width does NOT change the column/wrap
//                            structure (not parked on a wrap knife-edge).
//   T  capture not truncated — the full-page viewport is grown until .canvas no
//                            longer scrolls internally, so the -full.png shows
//                            the WHOLE deck (guards the evidence on tall pages).
//   U  cells fill (equal)   — within each leaf grid the single-cell .box cells
//                            are of EQUAL width (equal fr tracks), and every SLOT
//                            is EXACTLY --cell-h tall. SLOT, not component: the two
//                            height treatments legitimately differ from it in
//                            opposite directions — `rowspan` is a MULTIPLE of the
//                            slot, `half` a FRACTION (two components share one) — so
//                            both are excluded from the component-height set and the
//                            `.half-slot` wrapper is asserted at --cell-h directly.
//                            A THIRD family joins them: the SEPARATOR ROW. A row whose
//                            only occupants are HORIZONTAL separators is --sep-row-h,
//                            not --cell-h (one pixel of ink no longer costs a 130px
//                            cell), so U asserts every leaf grid's resolved row TRACK
//                            against what its occupants entitle it to — thin exactly
//                            where the ink is thin, both directions. That track pass
//                            also finally covers `.sep`/`.rail` height, which the
//                            .box-only height set never saw.
//                            The old fixed-232 width rule is gone: cells now STRETCH
//                            to fill, so width varies by section but is equal within
//                            a grid.
//   L  cells fill width      — RETIRED, superseded by RECT/HOLE (npm run check).
//      (retired -> RECT/HOLE) "Every row spans the grid edge to edge" is the
//                            rectangle-closure identity Σ(spanCols × rowspanRows)
//                            === tracks × rowCount, proved on the DATA rather than
//                            a pixel measurement, and a gap is named by coordinate
//                            instead of inferred from a right-edge delta.
//   C  description clamp     — no .box clips its content (desc clamped to 3
//                            lines keeps every box at CELL_H; clipped == 0).
//   O  no h-overflow         — canvas horizontal overflow == 0 at the stacked
//                            tiers (min/medium/large); tolerated only at the
//                            widest side-by-side tiers.
//   F  collapse cascade 3→2→1 — RETIRED, superseded by TIER (npm run check).
//      (retired -> TIER)      The …→2→1 cascade is a container query, so the
//                            track count per tier is a pure function of (authored
//                            columns, container width) — proved arithmetically at
//                            all five widths this sweep used to render, instead of
//                            re-rendering a multiplication table in a browser.
//   S  inline fit / band spans block (ALL tiers) — INLINE sections (span:1) hug
//                            their own grid (fit-content); BAND sections (span ==
//                            columns) span the BLOCK width at EVERY tier
//                            (mutually equal, ≥ the widest inline section). A
//                            band that shrinks to its single cell on collapse
//                            FAILS — a band must span the block at every width.
//   B  centered block        — at the widest tiers leftPad ≈ rightPad.
//   H  header within section  — no section header/subtitle overflows its section.
//   E  no empty grid column   — RETIRED, superseded by TRACK (npm run check). A
//      (retired -> TRACK)     dead track is a track no slot's (column, span) ever
//                            covers, a set operation on the authored data rather
//                            than a rendered measurement — and it guards the
//                            engine's grow-with-content clamp more directly.
//   P  no orphan cell         — RETIRED, superseded by ROW (npm run check). "A
//      (retired -> ROW)       lone cell on its own row while a sibling row holds
//                            2+" is a statement about PLACEMENT, and the placement
//                            is derivable: check-layout.mjs simulates CSS sparse
//                            auto-placement and counts row starts, carrying over
//                            P's exact scope (grid-dense forms, >1 track, rowspan-
//                            touched rows exempt).
//   V  verticality signal     — at the WIDEST tier the deck must earn its canvas:
//                            the ROOT places top-level sections side by side
//                            (rootRowMax ≥ 2, not one band per row) AND some leaf
//                            grid is multi-column. Prints a soft [SIGNAL] when
//                            horizontal density is low even if the floors pass.
//                            Catches a deck that collapses to a narrow centered
//                            single column wasting the horizontal space.
//   G  no balloon / overflow — (a) a LEAF component (box/sep/rail/spacer) sitting
//                            DIRECTLY in a compound ROW must be content-sized
//                            (flex-grow 0) — never grow to an equal slice (a lone
//                            box or a divider line ballooning); a sep/rail is also
//                            checked to stay thin in absolute width. (b) a nested
//                            section stacked in a columns:1 compound must keep its
//                            CONTENT height (flex-grow 0, scrollHeight<=clientH) —
//                            never be given a divided share shorter than its
//                            content that spills onto the next section. This is
//                            the hard guard for the compound-flex exemptions
//                            (sep/rail + box exemption and the sec-c1 reset): it
//                            reads the CAUSE on the live render, so it goes red
//                            BEFORE a spill grows large enough for X to see an
//                            actual box overlap.
//   Y  band fill             — a full-width BAND must FILL its width: its content
//                            spans the band edge-to-edge so each side gap is the
//                            zone padding only (small AND equal) — not a big dead
//                            margin from centering narrower content (the old hero
//                            "extra hueco" defect, L274/R274 each side). Asserted
//                            at width ≥ 1200.
//   N  word-fit             — (flow+dashboard) every leaf cell is at least as
//                            wide as the longest indivisible TOKEN of its title,
//                            measured on the live render; below that the title
//                            wraps mid-word under .box overflow-wrap:break-word
//                            (the S4 "Orquestac/ión" defect). Independent of M:
//                            a 136px cell clears M's 120px floor yet is narrower
//                            than a 12-char monospace title, so N catches what M
//                            misses. All tiers. A `vertical`-treatment title is
//                            EXEMPT (its title runs down the block axis, so
//                            horizontal token width is not the fit constraint).
//   K  filter integrity     — RETIRED, superseded by CHIP (npm run check). A
//      (retired -> CHIP)     chip/component join is a RELATION, not geometry, so
//                            it needs no render: check-layout.mjs closes the join
//                            in both directions AND adds ARITY (a one-member chip
//                            still blacks out the deck to spotlight a single box),
//                            a half this render-based row could never see.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// PLAYWRIGHT IS RESOLVED LAZILY, AND ITS ABSENCE IS NOT A FAILURE.
// This used to be a top-level `require('playwright')`, which made the optional
// gate impossible to even LOAD where the browser is not installed — the process
// died with MODULE_NOT_FOUND before printing anything, and a harness that only
// wanted the pure decision logic (the invariant table, the verdict, the census)
// dragged Chromium's whole dependency in with it. Gaia is installed in places
// where no browser exists; there, `npm run validate` must SKIP and exit 0, and
// the mandatory gate is `npm run check` (tools/check-layout.mjs), which needs
// nothing but js-yaml. See the degradation block in main().

  // rendered thing differ from that one number, and U recognises each EXPLICITLY —
  // with its own expected height — rather than exempting it:
  //   1. `rowspan` — the COMPONENT is a MULTIPLE of the slot. Excluded from the
  //      component-height set in measure(); the slot it covers is still CELL_H.
  //   2. `half`    — the COMPONENT is a FRACTION of the slot (two share one), so the
  //      subject moved from the component to the SLOT: every `.half-slot` (the
  //      wrapper that actually occupies the grid cell) must be exactly CELL_H and
  //      hold exactly 2 occupants. That is what proves `half` DIVIDED a slot rather
  //      than shrinking one and leaving a hole.
  //   3. THE SEPARATOR ROW — the ROW itself is thinner. A horizontal separator draws
  //      one pixel of ink and used to be charged a full CELL_H; a row whose ONLY
  //      occupants are horizontal separators is now SEP_ROW_H. The separator is still
  //      a cell (principle 1 is untouched), so this family is asserted on the TRACK:
  //      for every leaf grid, every resolved row track must equal SEP_ROW_H when
  //      every occupant of that row is a THIN LEAF — a horizontal separator, a
  //      declared hole (spacer), or a horizontal no-rowspan RAIL, mirroring the
  //      engine's isThinRowLeaf — and CELL_H otherwise; a TRAILING sep/hole thin
  //      row is a FLOOR (>= SEP_ROW_H), because the engine emits it as
  //      minmax(--sep-row-h, 1fr) to absorb the slack a stretched section
  //      leaves. A thin row that holds a RAIL is `auto` instead (a banner's
  //      content IS its row), asserted as the band RAIL_ROW_MIN..RAIL_ROW_MAX:
  //      one title line up to the two-line ceiling the static RAILT enforces.
  //      Both directions matter — a separator SHARING its row with boxes must
  //      NOT thin it (or the boxes clip), and an empty row (a hole, owned by
  //      RECT/HOLE in `npm run check`) must not be mistaken for a separator row.
  //      A VERTICAL separator is not in this family: its ink IS the row height, so its
  //      row stays CELL_H — measure() counts only `.sep:not(.sep-v)` as thin ink;
  //      a vertical or rowspan rail is excluded the same way.
  //      The same track measurement finally covers the height of the two leaf types
  //      the `.box`-only height set never saw: a `.sep`/`.rail` that overflows the
  //      row(s) it is entitled to is reported here (the --zone-min-h-vs---cell-h
  //      contradiction was a silent 50px spill with no invariant measuring it).

  //       has grown (flex-grow > 0) it takes an equal flex slice — a separator
  //       line or a lone box balloons to a full share. This is exactly the
  //       regression of the sep/rail/box exemption (fix-1 / bug #2). A separator
  //       is additionally checked to stay thin in absolute width — a divider line
  //       is never legitimately wide — as the observable EFFECT of the balloon.
  //       EXEMPT from that width clause: a `.msp` BAND sep/rail (span == columns),
  //       whose full-row width is authored (`.sec-grid.sec-compound > .msp` is
  //       flex:0 0 100% by design — the width is the assertion of ownership, the
  //       grid's substitute for an arrow). Its flex-grow is still asserted 0, and
  //       it must FILL its row instead — a band leaf shrunk below its row is the
  //       counterpart defect.
  //   (2) STACK OVERFLOW — a nested section (.zone) stacked in a columns:1
  //       (column-direction) compound must keep its CONTENT height (flex-grow 0).
  //       If it grows, a stretched parent divides its height between the stacked
  //       sections and a content-heavy one is given a box SHORTER than its
  //       content, which then spills onto the next section. Caught here as either
  //       flex-grow > 0 OR the section's own content overflowing its box
  //       (scrollHeight > clientHeight). This is the regression of the sec-c1
